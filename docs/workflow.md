## The Goal: Write Docs in Code, View as a Website

The main idea is to write your documentation **directly in your Python code** as docstrings. Sphinx then reads these docstrings and your handwritten guide files to "compile" a professional-looking website.

## The Workflow: Write ‚û°Ô∏è Build

Your documentation process has two simple parts:

1. **‚úçÔ∏è Write Documentation (Your Main Task)**
    
    - **In your `.py` files:** Write clear, NumPy-style docstrings for every class and function you create. This is where you'll spend most of your time.
        
    - **In your `docs/source/*.rst` files:** Occasionally, write higher-level guides, tutorials, or explanations of the science behind the code.
        
2. **üèóÔ∏è Build the Website (The Easy Part)**
    
    - When you want to preview your work, you run a single command to turn your docstrings and `.rst` files into an HTML website.
        

## Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps from your project's root directory in the VS Code terminal.

### Step 1: Build the HTML

Navigate into your `docs` folder and use the `make html` command.

```
cd docs
make html
```

This command tells Sphinx to generate the website and place it in the `docs/build/html/` directory.

### Step 2: View Your Documentation

Open the `index.html` file located in the build output folder in your web browser.

- **File Path:** `docs/build/html/index.html`
    

You can right-click this file in the VS Code explorer and select "Copy Path" to easily paste it into your browser's address bar.

### When to Re-build?

You only need to run `make html` when you want to see your latest changes. A good practice is to build after you've documented a new feature or before you commit your code to Git.

## Key Files to Remember

- **`docs/source/conf.py`**: The main configuration file. You edit this to add extensions (like `napoleon` for NumPy-style docstrings) and customize your site's look and feel.
    
- **`docs/source/index.rst`**: The homepage of your documentation website. You edit this file to create the main table of contents.
    
- **Your `*.py` files**: The most important part! This is where the docstrings live. Good docstrings lead to good documentation.
