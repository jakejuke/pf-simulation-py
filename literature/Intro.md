# Goals

I want to write a short summary for this project that explains the motivation, the phase-field method and provides some example use cases. New students/researchers should get a good overview after reading this. It should also help developers understand the physics of grain growth and the models behind the code. (We could add more detailed pages in the future that go into details like the Forward Euler Method, the Modified Euler Method, Misorientation, GB anisotropy, etc.) Maybe we could put this doc on a separate site later (once we take the project public).

# Motivation

- What is microstructure?
- Why are we interested in studying it?

- What is grain growth?
- Classical models of grain growth

- Why do we want to simulate grain growth?


# Phase-Field Method

## Background

## Basics

## State of the Art


# Some Applications

## Phenomenological Research
- Like Julian Jakob's Bachelor's thesis
- Check Raphael's work

## Training Data for ML Projects


# Bibliography
