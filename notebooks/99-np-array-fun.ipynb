    "Python's memory model isn't strictly \"pass-by-value\" or \"pass-by-reference\" like it is in C++. It's often called \"pass-by-assignment\" or \"pass-by-object-reference.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a simple way to think about it:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- When you create an object (like a big NumPy array), it lives in a specific place in memory.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- The variable you assign it to (e.g., `my_grid`) isn't the object itself; it's just a **label** or a **pointer** that points to the object in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pass `my_grid` to a function, Python **does not copy the entire array**. It only copies the small pointer. Inside the function, the parameter is a new label, but it points to the **exact same object** in memory."
